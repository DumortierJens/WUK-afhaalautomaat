# WUK afhaalautomaat

**WUK afhaalautomaat** is a school project for the module **Project One** of my study at **MCT Howest (Kortrijk)**. In this project I made a pickup locker for beer crates. 

### What is it?

**The idea** is that you pick up paid orders without anyone being present. You will have to enter an order number and a code through a touchscreen display, to open a locker that has been assigned to that order number.

You will be able to control the **pickup locker** through a local running website on the **Raspberry Pi**. Here you will be able to manage the orders and set the code of a locker. But also detect if someone passes in front of the locker and keep track of the temperature in the locker.

###   How did I make it?
For my project I needed to make an **instructable**: https://www.instructables.com/WUK-Pickup-Locker/. In this instructable you can **folow step by step** how I made the project or you can recreate it.
